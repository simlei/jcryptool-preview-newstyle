"""RSA is the most famous asymmetric cipher. It is called asymmetric, because it is used with a key that has two components: a public and a private part. In this plugin and in literature, the public part is called "e" and the private part is called "d". In contrast to symmetric ciphers, which use the same key for encryption and decryption, the public key allows anyone whom it is shared with to encrypt (e.g. "send") a message to the owner of the private key. But only with the private key, this message can be decrypted.
In this plug-in, messages are represented as single numbers for simplicity. The idea is, that any text can be expressed as a number â€” as long as the number can be arbitrarily big. But before messages can be encrypted and decrypted, the keys for RSA must be chosen, which is a multi-step process. This plug-in guides you through it and after the keys are chosen, you may encrypt or decrypt messages with the public and private keys."""
